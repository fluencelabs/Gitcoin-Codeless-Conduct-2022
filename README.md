Fluence is proud to sponsor this highly accessible hackathon to bring together creators of diverse backgrounds and skill sets to push the limits of Web3 and Fluence.


## About Fluence

Fluence provides the infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the Fluence peer-to-peer network host discoverable services comprised of WebAssembly Interface Types (IT) modules. Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language, allows developers to seamlessly program distributed networks and compose hosted services into decentralized applications. As a result, the Fluence platform allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and associated governance models.
